# Computer-Vision
This is the repository for my Computer Vision project.
For Assignment1 problem4 and Assignment4 problem1, execute measure_object_size.py. Before executing, you will have to download the 5cm * 5 cm aruco marker, print it out, and present the marker in the webcam. The application will work only when the marker is in the view of the camera.
